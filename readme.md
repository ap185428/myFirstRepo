## Learning about pull requests

#### What are pull requests ?
Pull requests are a feature that makes it easier for developers to collaborate. They provide a user-friendly web interface for discussing proposed changes before integrating them into the official project.
In their simplest form, pull requests are a mechanism for a developer to notify team members that they have completed a feature. Once their feature branch is ready, the developer files a pull request. This lets everybody involved know that they need to review the code and merge it into the master branch.
